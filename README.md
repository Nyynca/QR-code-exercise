## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is my first official exercise. I learned how to centre the text and one of many ways how to centre the div element. Furthermore, I believe I learned how to centre an image, though maybe I should focus more on that. Now that I think about it, the same thing with div elements. Positioning elements is currently the biggest hurdle.

### Continued development

The most problematic part during the creation was centring the image and the div 'outline' so that is surely something I will focus on in the future. Moreover, I'm still trying to understand how margins and padding work.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me with the centring I mentioned above. Currently, w3chools is my bffâ™¡.
